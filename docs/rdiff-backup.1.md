# NAME

**rdiff-backup** â€” local/remote mirror and incremental backup


# SYNOPSIS

| **rdiff-backup** \[options...] _action_ \[_sub-options_...] [_locations_...]
| **rdiff-backup** \[**\--new**] \[**-h**|**\--help**|**-V**|**\--version**]


# DESCRIPTION

rdiff-backup is a script, written in **python(1)** that backs up one directory
to another. The target directory ends up a copy (mirror) of the source
directory, but extra reverse diffs are stored in a special sub-directory of
that target directory, so you can still recover files lost
some time ago. The idea is to combine the best features of a mirror
and an incremental backup. rdiff-backup also preserves symlinks, special files, hardlinks, permissions, uid/gid ownership, and modification
times.

rdiff-backup can also operate in a bandwidth efficient manner over a
pipe, like **rsync(1)**. Thus you can use ssh and rdiff-backup to securely
back a hard drive up to a remote location, and only the differences
will be transmitted. Using the default settings, rdiff-backup requires
that the remote system accept ssh connections, and that rdiff-backup is
installed in the user's PATH on the remote system.
See the [REMOTE OPERATION](#remote-operation) section for details.

Note that you should not write to the mirror directory except with
rdiff-backup. Many of the increments are stored as reverse diffs, so
if you delete or modify a file, you may lose the ability to restore
previous versions of that file.

Finally, this man page is intended more as a precise description of the
behavior and syntax of rdiff-backup. New users may want to check out
the examples file included in the rdiff-backup distribution.

The rdiff-backup commands knows four types of parameters

1. generic options valid for all actions,
2. one action out of **backup**, **calculate**, **compare**, **info**,
   **list**, **regress**, **remove**, **restore**, **server**, **test**,
   **verify**,
3. sub-options applicable to each action specifically, even though some are
   common to multiple actions,
4. zero, one, two or more location paths, either local or remote.

Note that this documents the _new_ command line interface of rdiff-backup
since 2.1+; for the traditional one, check **rdiff-backup-old(1)** but
consider that it is deprecated and will disappear.

## Options

-h, \--help

:   Prints brief usage information and exits. Add **\--new** to be sure to get
    this CLI description, and not the old one.
    Placed _after_ the action, outputs the action's specific help message.

-V, \--version

:   Prints the current version number and exits.

\--api-version _apiversion_

:   Sets the API version to the given integer between minimum and
    maximum versions as given by the **info** action.
    It is the responsibility of the user to make sure that this version is
    also supported by any server started by this client.

\--chars-to-quote, \--override-chars-to-quote _chars_

:   If the filesystem to which we are backing up is not case-sensitive,
    automatic "quoting" of characters occurs. For example, a file
    '`Developer.doc`' will be converted into '`;068eveloper.doc`'.
    To quote other characters or force quoting, e.g. in case rdiff-backup
    doesn't recognize a case-insensitive file system, you need to specify
    this option. _chars_ is a string of characters fit to be used in regexp
    square brackets (e.g. '`A-Z`' as in '`[A-Z]`').

    **CAUTION:** do NOT change the chars to quote within the same repository!
    Actually, you only need to set this parameter when creating a new backup
    repository. Do also NOT quote any character used by rdiff-backup  in
    rdiff-backup-data (any of 'a-z0-9._-')!

\--current-time _currenttime_

:   This option is useful mainly for testing. If set, rdiff-backup
    will use it for the current time instead of consulting the
    clock. The argument is the number of seconds since the epoch.

\--force

:   Authorize a more drastic modification of a directory than usual
    (for instance, when overwriting of a destination path, or when
    removing multiple sessions with **remove**). rdiff-backup
    will generally tell you if it needs this.

    **CAUTION:** You can cause data loss if you mis-use this option.
    Furthermore, do NOT use this option when doing a restore, as it will
    DELETE files, unless you absolutely know what you are doing.

\--fsync, \--no-fsync

:   This will enable/disable issuing fsync from rdiff-backup altogether.
    This option is designed to optimize performance on busy backup
    systems.

    **CAUTION:** This may render your backup unusable in case of filesystem
    failure. Default is hence for fsync to be enabled.

\--new, \--no-new

:   enforce (or not) the usage of the new parameters. The default currently
    is to show the old usage, but this will change in the near future.

\--null-separator

:   Use nulls (`\0`) instead of newlines (`\n`) as line separators,
    which may help when dealing with filenames containing newlines.
    This affects the expected format of the files specified by the
    **\--{include|exclude}-filelist[-stdin]** switches as well as the
    format of the directory statistics file.

\--parsable-output

:   If set, rdiff-backup's output will be tailored for easy parsing
    by computers, instead of convenience for humans. Currently this
    only applies when listing increments using the **list increments** action,
    where the time will be given in seconds since the epoch.

\--remote-schema _remoteschema_

:   Specify an alternate method of connecting to a remote computer.
    This is necessary to get rdiff-backup not to use ssh for remote
    backups, or if, for instance, rdiff-backup is not in the PATH on
    the remote side.
    See the [REMOTE OPERATION](#remote-operation) section for details.

\--remote-tempdir _dirpath_

:   use path as temporary directory on the remote side of the connection.

\--restrict-path _dirpath_

:   Require that all file access be inside the given path. This
    switch, and **\--restrict-mode**, are intended to be used with the
    **\--server** switch to provide a bit more protection when doing
    automated remote backups.

    **CAUTION:** Those options are _not_ intended as your only line
    of defense so please don't do something silly like allow public
    access to an rdiff-backup server run with **\--restrict-mode read-only**.

\--restrict-mode {**read-write**,**read-only**,**update-only**}

:   restriction mode for the directory given by **\--restrict-path**, either
    full access (aka read-write), read-only, or only to update incrementally
    an already existing back-up (default is **read-write**).

\--ssh-compression, \--no-ssh-compression

:   use SSH with or without compression with default remote-schema.  This
    option is ignored when using **\--remote-schema**. Compression is on by
    default.

\--tempdir _dirpath_

:   Sets the directory that rdiff-backup uses for temporary files to
    the given path. The environment variables TMPDIR, TEMP, and TMP
    can also be used to set the temporary files directory. See the
    documentation of the Python tempfile module for more information.

\--terminal-verbosity {**0**,**1**,**2**,**3**,**4**,**5**,**6**,**7**,**8**,**9**}

:   select which verbosity to use for messages on the terminal,
    the default is given by **\--verbosity**.

\--use-compatible-timestamps

:   Create timestamps in which the hour/minute/second separator is a
    - (hyphen) instead of a : (colon). It is safe to use this option
    on one backup, and then not use it on another; rdiff-backup supports
    the intermingling of different timestamp formats. This option is enabled
    by default on platforms which require that the colon be escaped.

-v, \--verbosity {**0**,**1**,**2**,**3**,**4**,**5**,**6**,**7**,**8**,**9**}

:   Specify verbosity level (0 is totally silent, 3 is the default,
    and 9 is noisiest). This determines how much is written to the
    log file, and without using **\--terminal-verbosity** to the terminal..

## Actions

backup [[CREATION OPTIONS](#creation-options)] [[COMPRESSION OPTIONS](#compression-options)] [[SELECTION OPTIONS](#selection-options)] [[FILESYSTEM OPTIONS](#filesystem-options)] [[USER GROUP OPTIONS](#user-group-options)] [[STATISTICS OPTIONS](#statistics-options)] _sourcedir_ _targetdir_

:   back-up a source directory to a target backup repository.

calculate [\--method **average**] _statfile1_ _statfile2_ [...]

:   calculate average across multiple statistics files

    \--method **average**

    :   there is currently only one method and it is the default, but it might
        change in the future.

compare [[SELECTION OPTIONS](#selection-options)] [\--method _method_] [\--at _time_] _sourcedir_ _targetdir_

:   Compare a directory with the backup set at the given time. This
    can be useful to see how archived data differs from current
    data, or to check that a backup is current.

    \--method _method_

    :   method used to compare can be either **meta**, **full** or **hash**,
        where the default is **meta**, which is also how rdiff-backup decides
        which file needs to be backed-up. Note that with **full**, the
        repository data will be copied in its entirety to the source side and
        compared byte by byte. This is the slowest but most complete compare
        method. With **hash** only the SHA1 checksum of regular files will be
        compared. With **meta** only the metadata of files will be compared
        (name, size, date, type, etc).

    \--at _time_

    :   at which _time_ of the back-up directory should the comparaison take
        place. The default is **now**, meaning the latest version.
	See [TIME FORMATS](#time-formats) for details.

info

:   outputs information about the current system in YAML format, so that it
    can be used in a bug report, and exits.

list **files** [**\--changed-since** _time_|**\--at** _time_] _repository_

:   list modified or existing files in a given back-up repository.

    \--changed-since _time_

    :   List the files that have changed in the destination directory
        since the given time. See TIME FORMATS for the format of time.
        If a directory in the archive is specified, list only the files
        under that directory. This option does not read the source
        directory; it is used to compare the contents of two different
        rdiff-backup sessions.
	See [TIME FORMATS](#time-formats) for details.

    \--at _time_

    :   List the files in the archive that were present at the given
        time. If a directory in the archive is specified, list only the
        files under that directory.
	See [TIME FORMATS](#time-formats) for details.

list **increments** [**\--no-size**|**\--size**] _repository_

:   list increments with date in a given back-up repository.

    \--no-size,\--size

    :   Show or not the size of each increment in the repository. The default
        is to _not_ show sizes. When showing sizes, it becomes allowable to
        specify a directory within a repository, then only the cumulated
        sizes of that directory will be shown.

regress [[COMPRESSION OPTIONS](#compression-options)] [[USER GROUP OPTIONS](#user-group-options)] [[TIMESTAMP OPTIONS](#timestamp-options)] _repository_

:   If an rdiff-backup session fails, this action will undo the failed
    directory. This happens automatically if you attempt to back-up to a
    directory and the last backup failed.

remove **increments** **\--older-than** _time_

:   Remove the incremental backup information in the destination directory
    that has been around longer than the given time, or the oldest one if
    no time is provided.

    By default, rdiff-backup will only delete information from one
    session at a time. To remove two or more sessions at the same
    time, supply the **--force** option (rdiff-backup will tell you if
    it is required).

    Note that snapshots of deleted files are covered by this operation.
    Thus if you deleted a file two weeks ago, backed up immediately
    afterwards, and then ran rdiff-backup with remove-
    older-than 10D today, no trace of that file would remain.

    \--older-than _time_

    :   all the increments older than the given time will be deleted.
        See [TIME FORMATS](#time-formats) for details.

restore [[CREATION OPTIONS](#creation-options)] [[COMPRESSION OPTIONS](#compression-options-options)] [[SELECTION OPTIONS](#selection-options)] [[FILESYSTEM OPTIONS](#filesystem-options)] [[USER GROUP OPTIONS](#user-group-options)] [**--at** _time_|**--increment**] _source_ _targetdir_

:   restore a source backup repository at a specific time or a specific
    source increment to a target directory.
    See [RESTORING](#restoring) for details.

    \--at _time_

    :   the _source_ parameter is interpreted as a back-up directory, and
        the content is restored from the given time.
        See [TIME FORMATS](#time-formats) for details.

    \--increment

    :   the _source_ parameter is expected to be an increment within a
        back-up repository, to be restored into the given target directory.

server

:   Enter server mode (not to be invoked directly, but instead used
    by another rdiff-backup process on a remote computer).

test _remote_location_1_ [_remote_location_2_ ...]

:   Test for the presence of a compatible rdiff-backup server as
    specified in the following remote location argument(s) (of which
    the filename section will be ignored).
    See the [REMOTE OPERATION](#remote-operation) section for details.

verify **\--at** _time_ _location_

:   Check all the data in the repository at the given time by computing
    the SHA1 hash of all the regular files and comparing them
    with the hashes stored in the metadata file.

    \--at _time_

    :   the time of the data which needs to be verified.
        See [TIME FORMATS](#time-formats) for details.


# COMPRESSION OPTIONS

\--compression, \--no-compression

:   Disable the default gzip compression of most of the `.snapshot`
    and `.diff` increment files stored in the rdiff-backup-data directory.
    A backup volume can contain compressed and uncompressed
    increments, so using this option inconsistently is fine. 

\--not-compressed-regexp _regexp_

:   Do not compress increments based on files whose filenames match
    regexp. The default includes many common audiovisual and archive
    files, and may be found from the help.

# CREATION OPTIONS

\--create-full-path

:   Normally only the final directory of the destination path will
    be created if it does not exist. With this option, all missing
    directories on the destination path will be created. Use this
    option with care: if there is a typo in the remote path, the remote
    filesystem could fill up very quickly (by creating a duplicate
    backup tree). For this reason this option is primarily aimed at
    scripts which automate backups.

# FILESYSTEM OPTIONS
# SELECTION OPTIONS
# STATISTICS OPTIONS
# TIMESTAMP OPTIONS
# USER GROUP OPTIONS


# RESTORING
# TIME FORMATS
# REMOTE OPERATION
# FILE SELECTION
# USERS AND GROUPS
# STATISTICS


# FILES

*any-config-file*

:   you can create a file with one option/action/sub-option per line and
    use it on the command line with an ampersand prefix like
    _\@any-config-file_ and its content
    will be interpreted as if given on the command line.

    For example, creating a file '`mybackup`' with following content:

    ```
    --verbosity
    5
    backup
    source_dir
    target_dir
    ```

    and calling '`rdiff-backup @mybackup`' will be the same as calling
    '`rdiff-backup --verbosity 5 backup source_dir target_dir`'.


# ENVIRONMENT

**RDIFF_BACKUP_VERBOSITY**=_[0-9]_

:   the default verbosity for log file and terminal, can be
    overwritten by the corresponding options **-v/\--verbosity** and
    **\--terminal-verbosity**.
